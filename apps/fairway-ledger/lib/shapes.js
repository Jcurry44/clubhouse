/*
 * Fairway Ledger — canonical Round + Hole shapes.
 *
 * The point of this file is that there is exactly ONE place to look up "what
 * fields does a hole carry?" and "what fields does a round carry?". Adding a
 * new per-hole field (we've added several: notes, shots, clubsHit,
 * penaltyClub, firstPuttDistance, ...) is a one-line change here, and every
 * read/write path picks it up via the builders below.
 *
 * The shapes are intentionally additive — unknown fields on incoming data
 * are preserved, not stripped. We never want to drop a user's field by
 * accident when a future deploy hasn't seen the latest schema.
 *
 * Loaded both as a browser global (window.GolfShapes) and as a CommonJS
 * module for the test runner, same UMD pattern as lib/golf-math.js.

  // hole's `score` is null (not 0) so "user hasn't entered anything yet" is
  // distinguishable from "user scored 0", and `gir` defaults to false rather
  // than null so the boolean code paths don't have to deal with three states.
