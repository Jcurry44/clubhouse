/*
 * Fairway Ledger — golf game scoring engines.
 *
 * Pure math for the Games tab: given a game's per-hole entries, compute
 * standings, hole-by-hole outcomes, and (when a stake is set) the
 * end-of-round settlement. No DOM, no storage — everything here is a pure
 * function so it can be unit-tested in Node.
 *
 * Shared input shape (one entry per hole the group has played):
 *   hole = {
 *     number: 1..18,
 *     par: 3|4|5,                       // only consulted when meta.needsPar
 *     scores: { [playerId]: int|null },  // gross strokes; null = not entered
 *     wolf:  { wolfId, partnerId|null, lone: bool } | undefined   (Wolf only)
 *     bingo: { bingo: pid|null, bango: pid|null, bongo: pid|null } (BBB only)
 *   }
 *
 * A hole only counts toward a game's standings when it is "complete" for
 * that game (every needed score entered / every needed pick made). Partial
 * holes are simply ignored, so live standings stay truthful mid-hole.
 *
 * Same UMD pattern as lib/golf-math.js: window.GolfGames in the browser,
 * module.exports under Node for the test runner.
